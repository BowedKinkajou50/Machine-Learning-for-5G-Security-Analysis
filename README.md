# Machine Learning for 5G Security Analysis
## Idaho National Labratory
## Wireless networks are becoming both increasingly critical to modern life and increasingly complex and difficult to secure.  Applying ML to the analysis of cyber attack graphs, a common way to represent the steps for completing a cyber attack, represents a promising path for supporting the security of modern wireless networks.
