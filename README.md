# Machine Learning for 5G Security Analysis
## Idaho National Labratory
## Wireless networks are becoming both increasingly critical to modern life and increasingly complex and difficult to secure.  Applying ML to the analysis of cyber attack graphs, a common way to represent the steps for completing a cyber attack, represents a promising path for supporting the security of modern wireless networks.
The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others that will 
follow in your foot steps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the developmemnt of this project.
